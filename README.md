# PlacementPro

PlacementPro is an upcoming platform aimed at simplifying the college placement
process in India. The application connects students, colleges and companies
through a single portal and provides tools for resume building, job postings and
recruitment analytics.

This repository currently hosts project documentation:

- **`docs/`** – detailed technical specifications, infrastructure plans and the
  overall roadmap

Development of the actual source code will happen in dedicated repositories as
outlined in `docs/repository_structure.md`.
